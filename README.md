# Foundations of Computer Science and Web Development Bootcamp
_A [Code Fellows](http://codefellows.com) Bootcamp_

Welcome aboard! It's so good to have you in this Bootcamp.

The amount of material we have to cover is ambitious. You will get the most out of this class if you dive into the prework, take good notes, keep up with the assignments, independently research any topics you need extra time with, and generally stay inquisitive and curious.

## Requirements

 1. A working Mac or Linux laptop with:
    - plenty of free space on the hard drive, and ideally 8GB of RAM or more
    - free of any viruses and malware
    - using the latest, fully updated operating system
    - and able to reliably connect to the internet via wireless network
    - If you have a Windows laptop, you’ll want to set it up to dual boot into Linux. Much web development happens outside the MS stack. It’s good to learn. [Instructions to dual-boot with Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot)


 2. Please order your textbook NOW so they arrive before class starts.
    - Jon Duckett: [JavaScript &amp; jQuery](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118531647)
    - It’s also part of a 2-book set, both are excellent (but only the JavaScript one is required): [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118907442](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118907442)

## Prework

All prerequisites are listed in [The SEA-C32 Canvas Course](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/917209). Canvas is the Learning Management System (LMS) we'll be using for this course. You are responsible for all assignments, events, and communications posted there.

## Communication

Your invitation to Canvas will come in a separate email from an "instructure.com" email address. Look for the small link at the bottom of the email that says "Join" to get into the course without a "Join Code".

In addition to following this course through Canvas, you are also expected to check your email regularly. The class email list includes all your classmates and instructors. Use it wisely.

For real-time access to your classmates and TAs, you can also use the chat room, hosted by Slack.com. You'll receive an email invitation to that as well, right before class starts.


## Grading Policy

Code Fellows courses are ultimately graded on a complete/incomplete system. 90% of available points are required to complete the course. Individual assignments are usually graded out of 10 points. No points are taken off for late submissions, but be very wary of falling behind! Catching up in a timely manner is quite difficult.

Co-working and Q+A class time will allow for many interactive feedback opportunities for you. Take advantage of feedback and the one-on-one, in-person time for code reviews by instructors, TAs, and your peers.

Assignments and grades will be visible to you through Canvas, throughout the bootcamp. You’ll receive an invitation to Canvas a few weeks prior to the start of class, if you haven't already.

## Ready to Go?
